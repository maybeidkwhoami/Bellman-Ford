#Bellman-Ford Algorithm with Graph Visualization

  This Python script implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm for finding the shortest paths in a weighted directed graph. The script utilizes the tkinter library for creating a simple graphical user interface to input graph details and visualize the     graph using networkx and matplotlib.

#Features:

  Bellman-Ford Algorithm: Computes the shortest paths from a source vertex to all other vertices, detecting negative weight cycles.

  Graph Visualization: Utilizes networkx and matplotlib for visualizing the input graph.

  User-Friendly Interface: Allows users to input graph details easily through a graphical interface.

#Usage:

  1.Run the script.

  2.Enter the vertices separated by spaces and edges with their source, destination, and weight.

  3.Click "Ex√©cuter Bellman-Ford" to compute the shortest paths.

  4.Click "Visualiser le graphe" to visualize the input graph.

#Requirements:

  Python 3.x
  tkinter, networkx, and matplotlib libraries
